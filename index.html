                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Markus Karlsson and I'm a 27 year old guy from Gothenburg in Sweden. 
                    I live with my girlfriend Lisa and we love to travel and enjoy life. 
                    The best trip so far is South Africa back in 2018. Ever since I watched <i>The Lion King</i> 
                    as a kid I've always dreamed to meet these beautiful animals in the wild.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    If I don't hanging out with friends or family I spent the most of my time 
                    at the ice hockey rink trying to catch some pucks. Two other big interests
                    of mine are cooking & music. The perfect night for me is cooking a nice dinner in great 
                    company before heading to a concert and experience some live music.

                <h2>Work experience</h2>
                <p>Since 2011 I've been working at different warehouses and some other places. I started at 
                    <i>Swedish Match</i> after my graduation from upper secondary school. Between 2011-2016 I 
                    worked for the company when they suddenly decided to move all the business to Stockholm. 
                    I decided not to follow, instead I went on a two month trip to Australia & New Zeeland 
                    on my own. That's something I'll never regret, I learnt so much meeting new people and cultures 
                    from all over the world and were forced to speak english all the time. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Back home in Sweden again I started to work with my old boss from <i>Swedish Match</i> at 
                    a company called <i>Brammer</i>. I stayed there between 2016-2018 until it was time to lose 
                    my job for the same reason a second time. Shortly after I moved on to <i>Volvo</i> when I felt 
                    it was time to do something else. Through my ice hockey playing I met a guy in 2019 who had 
                    recently started a "digital foodcourt" called <i>Nordish Market</i> with his brother focusing 
                    on sustainable food. For me it was the perfect chance to work with cooking but unfortunately 
                    they couldn't offer me a full time job at that moment in time but it was still a great experience.
